# üöÄ v2.0.0 Migration Guide

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: Before using the app, you must run the SQL migration script in your Supabase dashboard.

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the following SQL script:

```sql
-- v2.0.0 Migration: Add owner and sync_source fields, clear data

-- Add new columns to credit_cards table
ALTER TABLE credit_cards 
ADD COLUMN owner TEXT DEFAULT 'self',
ADD COLUMN sync_source TEXT DEFAULT 'Manual';

-- Add new columns to expenses table (finances)
ALTER TABLE expenses 
ADD COLUMN owner TEXT DEFAULT 'self',
ADD COLUMN sync_source TEXT DEFAULT 'Manual';

-- Clear all existing data
DELETE FROM credit_cards;
DELETE FROM expenses;
```

### Step 2: Verify Changes

After running the migration:
1. Check that both tables now have `owner` and `sync_source` columns
2. Confirm all existing data has been cleared
3. Test adding new entries through the app
