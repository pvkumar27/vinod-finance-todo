# Push Notification Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Error Handling**: Added handling for "Requested entity was not found" error in both daily and noon notification functions
2. **URL Updates**: Changed all URLs from finance-to-dos.web.app to fintask.app
3. **Token Cleanup**: Removed 78 invalid FCM tokens from the database
4. **Test Function**: Added a testPushNotification function to verify push notifications

## Next Steps

### 1. Re-register Your Device

To properly register your iOS device with the correct information:

1. Open the FinTask app on your iOS device
2. Allow notifications when prompted
3. The app should automatically register a new token with:
   - Correct device type: "ios"
   - Correct email: "pvkumar27@gmail.com"
   - Complete FCM token

### 2. Test Push Notifications

After re-registering your device, test push notifications using:

```
curl "https://us-central1-finance-to-dos.cloudfunctions.net/testPushNotification?key=ggUbeLe1auQ5Lb6B2zUR6Ag%2BXW%2F7ffOh"
```

This will send a test notification to all registered devices and show:
- Device type
- Email address
- Success/failure status

### 3. Verify in Firebase Console

Check the Firebase Console to verify:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
2. Look for the `userTokens` collection
3. Verify the new token has been registered with correct values:
   - deviceType: "ios"
   - email: "pvkumar27@gmail.com"
   - userId: matches your user ID
   - token: complete FCM token (not truncated)

### 4. Regular Maintenance

To keep your push notifications working properly:

1. Periodically check for invalid tokens:
   ```
   curl "https://us-central1-finance-to-dos.cloudfunctions.net/testPushNotification?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. Monitor Firebase Functions logs for any errors

3. Consider upgrading Firebase dependencies as noted in the deployment warnings

## Technical Details

### Error Handling

The following error conditions are now handled in both notification functions:

```javascript
if (
  sendError.code === 'messaging/invalid-registration-token' ||
  sendError.code === 'messaging/registration-token-not-registered' ||
  sendError.message.includes('Requested entity was not found')
) {
  // Remove invalid token
}
```

### URL Updates

All URLs have been updated from `finance-to-dos.web.app` to `fintask.app` in:
- Email notifications (HTML and text versions)
- FCM image URLs for iOS notifications
