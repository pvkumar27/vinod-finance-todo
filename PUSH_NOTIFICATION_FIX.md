# Push Notification Scheduling Fix

## 🐛 Problem
Push notifications were not being sent on schedule because:
1. **Netlify scheduled functions are deprecated** and unreliable
2. **GitHub Actions only handled email** notifications  
3. **No unified scheduler** for both notification types

## ✅ Solution
**Unified GitHub Actions scheduler** that handles both email AND push notifications:

### Before (Broken)
```
GitHub Actions (9AM CT) → Email only
Netlify Scheduler (9AM CT) → Push only (unreliable)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
GitHub Actions (9AM CT) → Email + Push notifications
```

## 📁 Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/daily-notifications.yml` - Added push notification step
- `netlify/functions/scheduled-push-notifications.js` - Deprecated, kept for manual testing

## 🧪 Testing
1. **Manual trigger**: Use GitHub Actions "Run workflow" button
2. **Function test**: Both functions work independently via Netlify dashboard
3. **Scheduled run**: Will run daily at 9:00 AM Central Time

## 🔄 Deployment
1. Merge hotfix branch to main
2. GitHub Actions will automatically run the unified scheduler
3. Users will receive both email and push notifications daily

## 📊 Monitoring
Check GitHub Actions logs to verify both notification types are sent:
- ✅ Email notifications: Processed
- ✅ Push notifications: Processed
