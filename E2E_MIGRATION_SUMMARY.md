### Enhanced Scripts

```bash
# Core testing
npm run test:e2e                 # Run all tests
npm run test:e2e:open           # Interactive UI
npm run test:e2e:headed         # Headed mode

# Feature-specific testing
npm run test:e2e:ai             # AI assistant tests
npm run test:e2e:credit         # Credit card tests
npm run test:e2e:todos          # Todo tests
npm run test:e2e:expenses       # Expenses tests (future)

# Responsive testing
npm run test:e2e:mobile         # Mobile viewport
npm run test:e2e:tablet         # Tablet viewport

# Utility testing
npm run test:e2e:cleanup        # Cleanup only
npm run test:e2e:full           # Full test suite
```

### Safety Features

1. **Test Data Prefixing**: All test data uses `Test_E2E_` prefix
2. **Safe Cleanup**: Only deletes items with test prefix
3. **Environment Isolation**: Separate test credentials
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Tests adapt to missing features

### CI/CD Integration

- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Chrome browser support
- ✅ Screenshot/video artifacts
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ Parallel test execution

### Removed Legacy Code

- ❌ Playwright configuration and dependencies
- ❌ Old test structure in `tests/` directory
- ❌ Manual viewport management
- ❌ Complex page object patterns

### Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install` to get Cypress
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure test credentials
3. **Run Tests**: `npm run test:e2e:open` for interactive testing
4. **CI/CD Setup**: Update secrets in GitHub repository

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Testing**: More intuitive Cypress syntax
2. **AI-First Approach**: Tests aligned with new product direction
3. **Better Debugging**: Time travel and DOM snapshots
4. **Enhanced Coverage**: Comprehensive AI feature testing
5. **Modern Workflow**: Streamlined development process

## 🎯 Migration Aligned with AI-Driven Goals

The new test suite directly supports the FinTask AI-first transformation:

- **Credit Card Intelligence**: Tests promo tracking, inactivity alerts, utilization insights
- **Smart To-Do Management**: Tests AI suggestions, auto-prioritization, natural language input
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Tests contextual queries and dynamic dashboard generation
- **Cross-Device Experience**: Ensures AI features work on all device types

The migration successfully transforms the E2E testing approach from basic CRUD operations to comprehensive AI-driven feature validation, supporting the product's evolution into an intelligent finance assistant.
