# Creating a Firebase Service Account

To run the scripts, you need a service account file. Follow these steps:

2. Select your project "finance-to-dos"
3. Click the gear icon (⚙️) next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings"
4. Go to the "Service accounts" tab
5. Click "Generate new private key"
6. Save the downloaded file as `service-account.json` in the functions directory

Once you have the service account file, you can run the scripts.
