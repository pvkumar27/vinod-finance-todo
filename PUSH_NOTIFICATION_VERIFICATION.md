# Push Notification Verification Guide

## What We've Done
1. Fixed the error handling in the Cloud Functions to properly handle the "Requested entity was not found" error
2. Deployed the updated functions to Firebase
3. Successfully tested the email notifications

## Verifying Push Notifications

### Check if FCM Tokens Exist
1. Open the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/finance-to-dos
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Look for a collection called `userTokens`
4. If this collection exists and has documents, then FCM tokens are registered

### Check Firebase Functions Logs
1. In the Firebase Console, go to Functions
2. Click on "Logs" for the `sendDailyTaskReminders` function
3. Look for logs related to push notifications:
   - "Push notification sent to [device type] device"
   - "Push notifications sent to X/Y devices"
   - Any errors related to FCM tokens

### Test on a Device
1. Open the FinTask app on your mobile device
2. Make sure notifications are enabled for the app
3. Trigger the function again:
   ```
   curl "https://us-central1-finance-to-dos.cloudfunctions.net/sendDailyTaskReminders?key=ggUbeLe1auQ5Lb6B2zUR6Ag%2BXW%2F7ffOh"
   ```
4. Check if you receive a push notification on your device

### If Push Notifications Still Don't Work
1. Make sure your device has registered an FCM token:
   - Open the app on your device
   - Allow notifications when prompted
   - The app should automatically register a new token

2. Check if the token is valid:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to Cloud Messaging
   - Try sending a test message to your app

3. Update your app's service worker:
   - Make sure the service worker is properly handling FCM messages
   - Check for any console errors in the browser when receiving messages

## Next Steps
If push notifications are still not working after these steps, you may need to:

1. Check if your Firebase project is on the Blaze plan (required for FCM)
2. Verify that your app's manifest.json has the correct gcm_sender_id
3. Ensure the service worker is properly registered and handling FCM messages
4. Check for any browser or device-specific restrictions on push notifications
