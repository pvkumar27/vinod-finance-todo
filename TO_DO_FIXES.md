# To-Do Manager Fixes

The following issues have been fixed in the To-Do Manager:

## 1. Label Alignment
- Task and Due Date labels are now left-aligned
- Changed the CSS classes to ensure consistent alignment

## 2. Due Date Default Value
- Fixed the issue where the due date was defaulting to tomorrow's date
- Now correctly uses the local date instead of UTC date
- Created a helper function `getTodayDateString()` in `utils/dateUtils.js` to ensure consistent date formatting

## 3. Today Button Fix
- Fixed the Today button to correctly set today's date
- Now uses the same helper function to ensure consistency

## 4. Button Sizes in Mobile View
- Increased the size of Pin, Edit, and Delete buttons in the cards view
- Made them the same size as in the table view
- Added spacing between buttons for better touch targets
- Removed responsive sizing that was making them too small on mobile

## Implementation Details

### Date Handling
- Created a new utility function in `src/utils/dateUtils.js` that returns today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format using local time
- Updated all places in the code that were using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` to use this function instead

### Button Sizing
- Changed button classes from `w-3.5 h-3.5 sm:w-6 sm:h-6` to `w-6 h-6` to maintain consistent sizing
- Updated icon sizes to be more visible on mobile devices
- Added spacing between buttons with `space-x-1` for better touch targets

### Label Alignment
- Added `text-left` class to labels
- Removed `ml-1` class that was causing inconsistent alignment
- Added `block` class to ensure labels take full width

These changes ensure a more consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices.
