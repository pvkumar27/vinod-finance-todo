# FinTask Cleanup Fixes

## Issue Resolution

During the cleanup process, we encountered an issue where some test components that were moved to the archive directory were still being referenced in the codebase. This caused build failures with the following errors:

```
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './ExpensesTest' in 'C:\Users\pvkum\vinod-pwa\src\components'
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './ToDoTest' in 'C:\Users\pvkum\vinod-pwa\src\components'
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './SupabaseTest' in 'C:\Users\pvkum\vinod-pwa\src\components'
```

### Solution

1. Created simplified versions of the test components that were still being referenced:
   - `src/components/ExpensesTest.js` - Now uses `ExpensesDashboard` component
   - `src/components/ToDoTest.js` - Now uses `TaskManager` component
   - `src/components/SupabaseTest.js` - Now shows a static connection status

2. Updated the cleanup script to exclude these components from being moved to the archive directory

3. Updated the health check summary to reflect these changes

### Future Recommendations

1. **Refactor Component References**: Consider updating `TabNavigation.js` and `index.js` to reference the actual components directly instead of the test components.

2. **Component Consolidation**: Consider consolidating the functionality of test components into their respective dashboard components to reduce code duplication.

3. **Dependency Cleanup**: Review import statements across the codebase to identify and remove any other references to test or obsolete components.

## Build Status

The application now builds successfully with no errors.
