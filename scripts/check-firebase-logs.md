# Check Firebase Function Logs

## Steps to Check Logs:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/finance-to-dos/functions
2. Click on `sendDailyTaskReminders` function
3. Click on "Logs" tab
4. Look for logs from around 12:28 PM today (when the workflow ran)

## What to Look For:

### ✅ Expected Success Logs:
- "Sending push notifications as requested"
- "Starting push notification process for 22 tasks"
- "✅ Found X FCM token(s) in Firestore"
- "✅ Push notifications sent to X/Y devices"

### ❌ Possible Issue Logs:
- "Push notifications not requested, sendPush: false"
- "❌ No FCM tokens found in Firestore"
- "❌ No push notifications were successfully sent"
- Any error messages about invalid tokens

## Quick Check:
The workflow response "Sent notifications for 22 tasks" suggests the function completed, but we need to see if it actually attempted to send push notifications and what happened.
