# Push Notification Debug Steps

## Current Status
- ✅ 8 AM emails working
- ❌ 8 AM push notifications not working  
- ✅ Manual push notifications via app buttons working
- ✅ Cloud Function deployed with improved logging

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Logs
1. Go to: https://github.com/pvkumar27/vinod-finance-todo/actions
2. Look for "Daily Task Notifications (8:00 AM CT)" workflow runs
3. Check the logs for:
   - Function response
   - Any error messages
   - Whether `sendPush=true` is being passed

### 2. Check Firebase Function Logs
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/finance-to-dos/functions
2. Click on `sendDailyTaskReminders` function
3. Check logs for:
   - "Starting push notification process for X tasks"
   - "✅ Found X FCM token(s) in Firestore" 
   - "✅ Push notifications sent to X/Y devices"
   - Any error messages

### 3. Verify FCM Tokens Exist
The manual test buttons work, so tokens should exist. But let's verify:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Check `userTokens` collection
3. Verify there are valid tokens with your user ID

### 4. Test the Function Manually
Since we can't easily test with curl due to auth, we can:
1. Wait for the next scheduled run (8 AM CT)
2. Or manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Check the logs immediately after

## Expected Flow
1. GitHub Actions runs at 8:00 AM CT
2. Calls Cloud Function with `sendPush=true`
3. Function logs: "Sending push notifications as requested"
4. Function finds FCM tokens in Firestore
5. Function sends push notifications via FCM
6. You receive push notification on device

## Next Steps
1. Check the logs from the most recent workflow run
2. If logs show push notifications were sent but you didn't receive them:
   - Check device notification settings
   - Check if FCM tokens are valid
3. If logs show no push notifications sent:
   - Check if `sendPush=true` parameter is being passed
   - Check if FCM tokens exist in Firestore

## Quick Test
To test if the issue is with the workflow or the function:
1. Open FinTask app
2. Go to notification settings  
3. Click "Send Test Notification"
4. If this works but 8 AM notifications don't, the issue is in the workflow/function call
