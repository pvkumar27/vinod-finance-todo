# FinTask AI-Driven Feature Goals

## 🎯 Project Direction Shift (As of Sprint 2.3+)
The FinTask PWA is shifting toward becoming an AI-first productivity + finance assistant. The application should provide intelligent insights, context-aware assistant chat, and smart dashboards — all powered by natural language input.

## ✅ Core Modules Enhanced by AI

### 💳 Credit Cards (AI-Driven Features)
- **Promo APR Alerts** – Reminders before promo expiration.
- **Inactivity Risk Alerts** – Detect and alert for 90+ day card inactivity.
- **Credit Utilization Insights** – AI-powered analysis of card utilization.
- **Auto-Pay Status Monitoring** – Flag cards missing auto-pay.
- **"Last Used Date" Assistant Support** – Query like: _"When did I last use Chase card?"_

### 💸 Expenses (AI-Driven Features)
- **Smart Categorization** – AI auto-tags merchant names into categories.
- **Spending Pattern Alerts** – Detect spikes, drops, or anomalies.
- **Forecasting** – Predict next month’s spending.
- **Assistant Queries** – Support prompts like:
  - _"How much did I spend on gas in June?"_
  - _"List all expenses over $200 this month"_

### ✅ To-Dos (AI-Driven Features)
- **Smart Suggestions** – Based on finance patterns and date triggers.
- **Auto Prioritization** – Sort tasks by urgency and context.
- **Natural Language Additions** – AI assistant adds tasks from plain language.
- **Recurring Detection** – Detect recurring patterns and suggest them.

## 🤖 AI Assistant Query Capabilities
Users should be able to ask:
- _"When will my promo expire on Amex?"_
- _"Which card wasn’t used recently?"_
- _"Add 'Pay Rent' task monthly"_
- _"What’s my grocery spend this week?"_

## 📊 Dynamic Dashboards (AI-Triggered)
- Dashboards should no longer be static.
- Assistant should generate visualizations on demand like:
  - _"Show July expenses by category"_
  - _"Visualize credit utilization"_
  - _"What tasks are overdue?"_

## 🚫 What is NOT Required
- Shared to-do lists
- Dark mode
- Manual entry for cash/checks (only card/bank data)
- Custom notification times (fixed daily reminder preferred)

## 🔁 Next Steps
- Add these features to backlog with priority
- Update assistant logic to support contextual queries
- Replace fixed dashboards with dynamic components
- Begin Assistant Chat integration across Credit Cards, Expenses, To-Dos
